While working on this project via [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://nft-site-lucieyarish.netlify.app/), I learned/practiced some of the very important HTML & CSS concepts:

- Semantic HTML and accessibility
- `hover` and `active` states using pseudo selectors
- CSS specificity
- Compound selectors and when to avoid them
- `inline-block`
- Keeping CSS file organized and DRY
- Multiple classes on one element
