While working on this project via [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), I learned/practiced some of the very important HTML & CSS concepts:

- Semantic HTML and accessibility
- `hover` and `active` states using pseudo selectors
- CSS specificity
- Compound selectors and when to avoid them
- `inline-block`
- Keeping CSS file organized and DRY
- Multiple classes on one element

## Rebuilding the Site to be Fully Responsive
This site was rebuilt once I learned about responsive design in the course. The following concepts were applied to make the site fully responsive:
- Changing all sizes defined in `px` to `em` and `rem`
- Media queries and mobile-first approach
- Responsive nav bar
- `flex-wrap`, `flex-basis`, `flex-grow` and `gap`
